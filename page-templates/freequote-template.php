						<h3>What is the Average Cost of a Move?</h3>
						<p>Talking about relocation is a very broad topic. A move can mean a local move to the other side of the city or a long-distance one to the other side of the country. When talking about the average costs, it is crucial to know what kind of relocation is being carried out. Apart from the distance of the move, it is also essential to know the size of the residence. However, without going into details (which are covered below) studies show that an average local move is around 600-1500 dollars. Meanwhile, cross-country moves tend to range anywhere from 2000-4000 dollars. Knowing the average cost of these services will help you plan out and prepare a budget.</p>
						<h3>The Difference Between Local and Cross-Country Moves</h3>
						<p>As we mentioned, local and cross country movers price their services differently. A local mover tends to charge by the hour. They typically charge $30-$50 per hour, and it is vital to get their price early on in the call. On the other hand, a long-distance mover has a different pricing system. They take into account factors such as the area that has to be covered, weight, and additional services. Contact your company to find out what their pricing system is based on.</p>
						<h3>How the Number of Bedrooms Affects Moving Costs</h3>
						<p>Companies tend to measure the size of a home by the number of bedrooms. The smallest home is considered a studio apartment, while bigger homes can go up to six or more bedrooms. The more bedrooms are in a home, the more time and effort it will take when it comes to packing and relocating. More complex moves will also require more workforce, which can also affect the price.</p>

						<p>No matter how good a quote seems, it is important not to commit just because the service appears affordable. Before hiring a specific mover, you need to do some research to make sure they are a legitimate business. These tips might seem like an additional effort, but they can spare you the trouble of going through a bad relocation.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Make sure that the company you are communicating with has federal authorization. This is an official authorization handed out by the FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) that grants a business the right to move items over state lines.</li>
							<li>Make sure you contrast and compare prices and packages of various companies. It will help you determine how much different firms charge for the same services and allow you to make a more accurate decision.</li>
							<li>Are they experienced? Nobody wants to hand over their precious belongings to someone wanting to make a quick buck. Make sure that the people handling your relocation are experienced and qualified for the job.</li>
							<li>Ask for a point of contact. You will need someone you can reach and ask for additional information during this time. Dealing with one person will make the entire process less complicated and easier to understand.</li>

					<h2>What Kind Of Moving Estimate Are You Getting?</h2>
					<div class="bottom-cta-text">
						<p>It is crucial to keep in mind that the industry has its own jargon and that not all estimates are equal. The two must-know estimates are the ballpark estimate and the detailed estimate.</p>
						<p>Ballpark estimates are made with limited information about the move and are considered preliminary. They are best used when contacting multiple companies for price comparison.</p>
						<p>Detailed estimates take into account a lot more information and work out a more accurate estimate. Many customers stick to a ballpark quote and are unsatisfied when their service ends up costing more than expected. Make sure the assessment you are working with is accurate and has taken into account all the factors of your relocation.</p>
